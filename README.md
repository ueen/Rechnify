# Rechnify / Invoicify
simplify sending invoices
--------
Created as an way to ease sending invoices via e-mail to nonprofit clubs for small fees. its in german should be easy to cutomize.

Just html, css, js, php, no database, no dependencies.

Cutomize was.json (items to add to the invoice) and vorlage.json (recipient and email content).

Feel free to file an issue or a PR to improve this. It's not supposed to be fancy, its supposed to be easy :)

TODO:
maybe add passwort protection to prevent spam //alternative: host internally eg. in wiki
